    <p>Hi, My name is Joseph Hyatt. Highly motivated front end developer with experience in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, WordPress, Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I focus on writing clean, elegant and efficient code. I love creating websites, I take challenges as inspiration and always looking for improvements. I believe in hard work and sharing what I know. My goal is to be successful by building fast and responsive websites which work today and in the future on every device possible.</p>
    <br>
    <p>On my off time I like to take my dog Duke out for walks, go out to eat, drink coffee and travel to new places.  I also like to get some ps4 in while I can. Big Call of Duty and BattleField fan, message me if you feel like putting your skills to the test :). Thank you for checking out my portfolio.  </p>
